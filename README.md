### Background

This package provides tools for visual exploration of stellar evolution data using the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with differing data sets.

### What is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, or H-R diagram, is a powerful tool classifying stars in order to understand the nature of stellar evolution.  More specifically, from Wikipedia, we have "The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, abbreviated H–R diagram, HR diagram or HRD, is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures. More simply, it plots each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness against its temperature (color). It does not map any locations of stars. The related colour–magnitude diagram (CMD) plots the apparent magnitudes of stars against their colour, usually for a cluster so that the stars are all at the same distance. The diagram was created circa 1910 by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell and represents a major step towards an understanding of stellar evolution."
